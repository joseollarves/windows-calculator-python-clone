    <p>It just covers the most basic functionality of the calculator, but I tried to replicate the original GUI as most as I could, The delete icon comes from the <a href='https://github.com/feathericons/feather'>Feather Icons</a> library. The icon of the app is the same as the Windows Calculator.</p>
